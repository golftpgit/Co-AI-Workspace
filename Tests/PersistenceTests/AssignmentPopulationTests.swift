// What the forecast band is made of, now that there is something honest to make
// it from (ARCHITECTURE §19.7, P10.15).
//
// The band has been wrong twice. First it was every span carrying a role, which
// is overwhelmingly `tool:kb_search`, so a schedule was drawn from a p90 of
// search calls. Then it was completed chat turns — closer, but a turn is a
// message-and-tools round trip standing in for a reviewed promise, and it reads
// low. Both times the arithmetic was right and the population was wrong, which
// is why these tests are all about which rows come back rather than about
// quantiles.
