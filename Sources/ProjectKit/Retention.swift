// Retention (ARCHITECTURE §20.5, §19.12 condition 8, P11.10) — what happens to
// somebody's answers after the study ends.
//
// **What was wrong before this.** Condition 8 asked for a `DataDisposition`
// whose `policy` was any non-empty string. Typing "we will sort it out" passed
// it. So the gate that exists to make the promise made to participants
// survive the end of the project could be satisfied without there being a
// promise at all — box-ticking, which is the exact thing `isDecided` was
// written to prevent and did not.
//
// **What makes it enforced.** §20.5 puts the retention rule in the `policy`
// scope, which is a real place with real documents (§11.2). So the disposition
// now has to name a rule that is *in there*, and the gate answers in three
// ways — deliberately the same three as `ProjectTypeGate` (P11.1), because a
// second vocabulary for "we cannot check this yet" is how one of them rots:
//
//   • a rule exists and the disposition names it   → check it, block if false
//   • the project never collected data from people → the condition does not
//     apply, and says so rather than showing a tick that means nothing
//   • data was collected and no retention rule exists → **block**, because
//     that is a study that promised something to participants and wrote it
//     down nowhere
//
// **What it does not do: delete anything.** P10.10 settled that condition 8
// records the decision and the system does not remove files on somebody's
// behalf, and that stands — an app that quietly deletes a folder because a
// date passed is worse than one that reminds you. Closing records an
// *obligation* with the date it falls due, and that obligation is the thing a
// person can be shown later.
