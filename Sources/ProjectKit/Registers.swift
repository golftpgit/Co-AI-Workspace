// The five registers (ARCHITECTURE §19.11, P10.8).
//
// One shape, five kinds. They share everything that makes a register useful —
// who raised it, who owns it, what state it is in, when it changed — and differ
// only in the fields that decide what to do about it. Five separate tables
// would have produced five slightly different answers to "is this still open".
//
// One rule is not shared, and it is the reason `decide` exists: **a change is
// decided by a person, always** (§19.11). An agent may propose one — that is
// most of the value — but approving a change to the baseline is the thing the
// standards reserve for whoever owns the business case, and here that is never
// an agent.
